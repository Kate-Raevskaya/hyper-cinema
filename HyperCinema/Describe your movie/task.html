<p>In this stage, we will deal with movie descriptions: title, rating, genres, etc. So, decide which movies/cartoons/series you want to show in your online cinema.</p>
<p>We chose <em>Shrek</em>, a cult cartoon from the beginning of the 2000s, and decided to take all the information about it from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IMDB</a>. We decided to use the cartoon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Big Buck Bunny</a> as a test video.</p>
<p>What will you choose?</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Let's bring life to our player and add a link to a video file to it (you can use a local file from your computer or use, for example, the link to the cartoon from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/c/c0/Big_Buck_Bunny_4K.webm/Big_Buck_Bunny_4K.webm.480p.vp9.webm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). Do not forget that your player should display the controls;</li>
<li>Take a look at your next <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/796777/HyperCinema_Stage_2.fig" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Figma file</a>. Don't forget the class, id, and tag hints from the previous step;</li>
<li>Choose the movie you want to add to your cinema (or use Shrek). There are conditions for displaying a movie: the title should fit in one line to fit the age rating, the description should be no more than four lines, directors and genres should also fit in one line;</li>
<li>Add all the elements to your page exactly as indicated in Figma. Fonts, sizes, colors â€” everything;</li>
<li>You can use a table to display directors, genres, and ratings;</li>
<li>When you go over buttons, they should change their background and font colors as indicated on the layout (imagine that the mouse is over the <code class="java">Trailer</code> button);</li>
<li>Add a link with the movie cartoon to the player. Lean back and relax.</li>
</ol>
